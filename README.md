# AI
Created an AI game to imitate two gangs fighting against each other to take over the city using Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms.
Used Java to code various constraints at every step having two possible outcomes of Stake and Raid. Stake can take any open space on the board whereas Raid can conquer the enemy state spaces also.
Displayed the best possible move of a gang at a particular depth where the objective is to score more points than the other gang.
